# Nabokos 

Nabokos is a sokoban style game written in coffee-script and uses HTML5's canvas for rendering. The game started out as a weekend project to learn coffee-script but I plan to add more to it over time, mainly new levels. If you find any bugs or want to implement a feature then send me a pull request and I'll be happy to merge it. You can play the game on [my website](http://www.eblundell.com/nabokos).
